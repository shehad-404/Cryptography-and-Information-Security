# Cryptography-and-Network-Security

**Cryptography** is the practice and study of techniques for securing communication and data from unauthorized access or manipulation. It ensures confidentiality, integrity, authentication, and non-repudiation of information using methods like encryption, decryption, and hashing.

**Information Security** encompasses broader measures to protect information (digital or physical) from threats like unauthorized access, destruction, or theft. It involves implementing security controls, policies, and practices across three pillars: **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability** (the CIA triad). Cryptography is a vital tool in achieving information security.
